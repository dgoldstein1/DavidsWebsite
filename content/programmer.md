Since high school, my passion for problem solving, drive to look at problems in unique ways, and appreciation for symmetry and harmony in solutions has pushed me towards computer science. Programming lies at the intersection of my personal and academic interests as a tool to draw relationships in data, process and organize large amounts of information beyond the capabilities of the human mind, and generate new understandings of the world around us. 

I am constantly working on new coding projects both inside and outside the office to keep up my coding skills and explore relationships in data in new and interesting ways. Here are a few I've been working on recently:

- <a style={{text-decoration : "underline"}} href="https://github.com/dgoldstein1/Synonym_Analyzer"> Analyzing synonyms in English </a> using multi-threaded requests and <a href="https://graph-tool.skewed.de/"> Graph Tools</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/dgoldstein1/ReactTestingTutorial"> A tutorial on testing components in React </a>
- <a href="https://github.com/dgoldstein1/projectEuler"> Solving the Project Euler problem set in C</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/dgoldstein1/Directory_Encryptor"> A tool to encrypt filesystems </a>

<h3>Languages</h3>

I believe in full stack development. Computers work best when the developer knows what's going on throughout the whole system-- from each instruction to every pixel on the screen. Here are the languages I have used professionally and in my own work :

<div class="table-wrapper">
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Language</th>

                <th>Types of Work</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>

                <td>Javascript</td>
                <td>Very Comfortable</td>

            <tr>

            <tr>

                <td>Some Experience</td>
                <td>End-to-end testing, creating micro-services</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
        <tfoot>

I have also used professionally and am comfortable with the following tools and frameworks:

- Elastic Search
- AWS (C2S, S3, Reddis)
- Docker
- Confluence / Github / Gitlab team management, Pivotal Tracker
- Filestreams, eventstreams, web-sockets
- npm, jspm, maven, pip + virtualenv, apt, brew
- JS utils: lodash, jquery, q
- selenium, <a href="https://github.com/jsweetland/blackbox">blackbox</a>

<h3>Research</h3>

Outside of coding I have written a few papers about various aspects of computer science during my coursework at Macalester College and the American University of Sharjah, UAE :
