Since high school, my passion for problem solving, drive to look at problems in unique ways, and appreciation for symetry and harmony in solutions has pushed me towards computer science. Programming lies at the intersection of my personal and academic interests as a tool to draw relationships in data, process and organize large amounts of information beyond the capaibilites of the human mind, and generate new understandings of the world around us. 

I am constantly working on new coding projects both inside and outside the office to keep up my coding skills and explore relationships in data in new and interesting ways. Here are a few I've been working on recently:

* <a href="https://github.com/dgoldstein1/ReactTestingTutorial"> A tutorial on testing components in React </a>
* <a href="https://github.com/dgoldstein1/projectEuler"> Solving the Project Euler problem set in C</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/dgoldstein1/Directory_Encryptor"> A tool to encrypt filesystems </a>
