I have always had a passion for learning new languages and learning how other cultures communicate around the world. My travels have brought me throughout the Middle East and have become part of who I am.

Below are my language proficiencies broken down on the <a href="http://www.govtilr.org/Skills/ILRscale1.htm">DOD ILR Scale</a>

I am always seeking new ways to use my linguistic abilities -- from creating boggle in different languages to reading Arabic literature in my free time. In college I lived in the French and Arabic houses -- speaking exclusively in foreign languages -- and I still read the news everyday in Arabic and French.

Throughout my professional career, I have also used language as a tool to better understand immigration, international relations, music, and computer science. As a volunteer translator in Minneapolis, I helped translate official documents, including passports, affidavits, business contracts, and political correspondence from French and Arabic to English.

I also volunteered with the <a href="https://reconciliationproject.org"> Iraqi and American Reconciliation Project (IARP)</a> by meeting and assisting Iraqi immigrants around the Twin Cities and worked at <a href="http://www.mizna.org"> MIZNA </a>, an Arab arts NGO promoting Arab-American arts and culture in Minnesota.
