Over the last century, the nature of international conflict has changed drastically, and with it, Humanitarian law and global assistance. More than <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/figures-at-a-glance.html">65 million people are forcibly displaced from their home</a> and the number is growing.
As an advocate for international Human Rights I have made it a priority to assist and amplify the voices of refugees and asylum speakers in the US and abroad.

In the Twin Cities, I've had the opportunity to put this mission into action by working with and assisting a diverse set of migrants and refugees. Working for the <a href="http://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/">Advocates for Human Rights</a>, an international NGO based in Minneapolis, and <a href="http://www.karamlaw.com/">Karam Law</a>, a private immigration law firm in Bloomington, MN, I provided French and Arabic translation, assisted in filings to USCIS, helped write briefs and other court filings, and worked with attorneys and immigrants throughout sometimes long and complex legal procedures.

Working at the US State Department in the <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/prm/"> Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration</a> in the Office for the Middle East and Northern Africa, I helped organize vital assistance for refugees in Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Palestine, and Egypt. I also helped lobbying and collaboration efforts with other government entities, such as the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, the White House, and the House and Senate, to affirm the US's commitment to refugees and refugee assistance world-wide.
