Playing piano and singing in Choirs have always been at the center of my life. From singing in choral groups, to playing jazz piano and drums, to acting and singing in musicals, I have always been part of a musical community. 

<h3>Macalester Concert Choir</h3>

During college, I took part in the vibrant choral network in the Twin Cities by singing with the Macalester Concert Choir, an elite group of 40 singers which sings a variety of classical and contemporary arrangements.

Over the course of my four years in the Concert Choir I traveled throughout the Midwest and US singing in churches, colleges and universities, in peoples' homes, and everywhere in between. Here is a selection our work sung during that time:

Playing piano and drums has always held a special place in my heart as a means of self-expressions, comfort, and introspection. While always an avocation, I have played drums and piano with various groups.

In high school, I played drums in a few local bands and learned about Afro-Cuban music at Berklee College of Music and the Rivers School Conservatory in Weston, MA.
