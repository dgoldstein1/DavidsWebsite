Gone are the days when we have one career for our entire professional life. A fast-paced, connected world needs even more dynamic and cross-discipline work force. Crossing boundaries and disciplines, I put my diversity of skills and assets into all the work I do. Beyond my work in Computer Science, Arabic, International Relations, or Public Service, I am a critical thinker looking to solve the world's problems in a newly energetic and cross-cutting way.
