Gone are the days when we have one career for our entire professional life. A fast-paced, connected world needs even more dynamic and cross-discipline work force. Crossing boundaries and disciplines, I put my diversity of skills and assets into all the work I do.

Beyond my work in Computer Science, Arabic, International Relations, or commitment to equal rights and public service, I am a problem solver. I seek to understand how the world works around me and and thrive in an environment where I use this understanding to solve the world's problems with newly energenic and cross-cutting solutions.

Originally from Sharon, Massachusetts, and attened Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota, I now live happily with my fianc√© in Washington, D.C., who works at an NGO helping girls in rural Kenya. In my spare time I enjoy hiking in Shenandoah National Park, running around DC, biking along the Potomac, and on rainy days, playing piano by the window or curling up with a good book.
