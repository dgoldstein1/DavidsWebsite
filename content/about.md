Gone are the days when we have one career for our entire professional life. A fast-paced, connected world needs an even more dynamic and cross-discipline work force. Crossing boundaries and disciplines, I put my diversity of skills and assets into all the work I do.

Beyond my work in Computer Science, Arabic, International Relations, or commitment to equal rights and public service, I am a problem solver. I seek to understand how the world works around me and and thrive in an environment where I use this understanding to solve the world's problems with newly energetic and cross-cutting solutions.

Originally from Sharon, Massachusetts, and graduated Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota and now live happily with my fianc√© in Washington, D.C., who works at an NGO helping girls in rural Kenya. In my spare time I enjoy hiking in Shenandoah National Park, running around DC, biking along the Potomac, and on rainy days, playing piano by the window, solving math problems in C, or curling up with a good book.
