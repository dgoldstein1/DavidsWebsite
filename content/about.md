{{< figure class="image main" src="/images/DavidHiking.jpg" >}}

Gone are the days when we have one career for our entire professional life. A fast-paced, connected world needs even more dynamic and cross-discipline work force. Crossing boundaries and disciplines, I put my diversity of skills and assets into all the work I do.

Beyond my work in Computer Science, Arabic, International Relations, or commitment to equal rights and public service, I am a problem solver. I seek to understand how the world works around me and and thrive in an environment where I use this understanding to solve the world's problems with newly energenic and cross-cutting solutions.
