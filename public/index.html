<p>Gone are the days when we have one career for our entire professional life. A fast-paced, connected world needs even more dynamic and cross-discipline work force. Crossing boundaries and disciplines, I put my diversity of skills and assets into all the work I do.</p>

<p>Beyond my work in Computer Science, Arabic, International Relations, or commitment to equal rights and public service, I am a problem solver. I seek to understand how the world works around me and and thrive in an environment where I use this understanding to solve the world&rsquo;s problems with newly energenic and cross-cutting solutions.</p>

<p>Originally from Sharon, Massachusetts, and attened Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota, I now live happily with my fiancé in Washington, D.C., who works at an NGO helping girls in rural Kenya. In my spare time I enjoy hiking in Shenandoah National Park, running around DC, biking along the Potomac, and on rainy days, playing piano by the window or curling up with a good book.</p>

Over the last century, the nature of international conflict has changed drastically, and with it, Humanitarian law and global assistance. More than <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/figures-at-a-glance.html">65 million people are forcibly displaced from their home</a> and the number is growing.
As an advocate for international Human Rights I have made it a priority to assist and amplify the voices of refugees and asylum speakers in the US and abroad.</p>


<figure class="image main">
    
        <img src="/images/USCIS.jpg" />

<p>In the Twin Cities, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to put this mission into action by working with and assisting a diverse set of migrants and refugees. Working for the <a href="http://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/">Advocates for Human Rights</a>, an international NGO based in Minneapolis, and <a href="http://www.karamlaw.com/">Karam Law</a>, a private immigration law firm in Bloomington, MN, I provided French and Arabic translation, assisted in filings to USCIS, helped write briefs and other court filings, and worked with attorneys and immigrants throughout sometimes long and complex legal procedures.</p>

<p>Working at the US State Department in the <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/prm/"> Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration</a> in the Office for the Middle East and Northern Africa, I helped organize vital assistance for refugees in Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Palestine, and Egypt. I also helped lobbying and collaboration efforts with other government entities, such as the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, the White House, and the House and Senate, to affirm the US&rsquo;s commitment to refugees and refugee assistance world-wide.</p>

<p>I have always had a passion for learning new languages and learning how other cultures communicate around the world. My travels have brought me throughout the Middle East and have become part of who I am.</p>

<p>I am always seeking new ways to use my linguistic abilities &ndash; from creating boggle in different languages to reading Arabic literature in my free time. In college I lived in the French and Arabic houses &ndash; speaking exclusively in foreign languages &ndash; and I still read the news everyday in Arabic and French.</p>

<p>Throughout my professional career, I have also used language as a tool to better understand immigration, international relations, music, and computer science. As a volunteer translator in Minneapolis, I helped translate official documents, including passports, affidavits, business contracts, and political correspondence from French and Arabic to English.</p>

<p>I also volunteered with the <a href="https://reconciliationproject.org"> Iraqi and American Reconciliation Project (IARP)</a> by meeting and assisting Iraqi immigrants around the Twin Cities and worked at <a href="http://www.mizna.org"> MIZNA </a>, an Arab arts NGO promoting Arab-American arts and culture in Minnesota.</p>

<p>Since high school, my passion for problem solving, drive to look at problems in unique ways, and appreciation for symmetry and harmony in solutions has pushed me towards computer science. Programming lies at the intersection of my personal and academic interests as a tool to draw relationships in data, process and organize large amounts of information beyond the capabilities of the human mind, and generate new understandings of the world around us.</p>

<p>I am constantly working on new coding projects both inside and outside the office to keep up my coding skills and explore relationships in data in new and interesting ways. Here are a few I&rsquo;ve been working on recently:</p>

<ul>
<li><a style={{text-decoration : "underline"}} href="https://github.com/dgoldstein1/Synonym_Analyzer"> Analyzing synonyms in English </a> using multi-threaded requests and <a href="https://graph-tool.skewed.de/"> Graph Tools</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/dgoldstein1/Directory_Encryptor"> A tool to encrypt filesystems </a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Languages</h3>

<p>I believe in full stack development. Computers work best when the developer knows what&rsquo;s going on throughout the whole system&ndash; from each instruction to every pixel on the screen. Here are the languages I have used professionally and in my own work :</p>

<p>Playing piano and singing in Choirs have always been at the center of my life. From singing in choral groups, to playing jazz piano and drums, to acting and singing in musicals, I have always been part of a musical community.</p>

<h3>Macalester Concert Choir</h3>

<p>During college, I took part in the vibrant choral network in the Twin Cities by singing with the Macalester Concert Choir, an elite group of 40 singers which sings a variety of classical and contemporary arrangements.</p>

<p>Over the course of my four years in the Concert Choir I traveled throughout the Midwest and US singing in churches, colleges and universities, in peoples&rsquo; homes, and everywhere in between. Here is a selection our work sung during that time:</p>

</p>

<p>Playing piano and drums has always held a special place in my heart as a means of self-expressions, comfort, and introspection. While always an avocation, I have played drums and piano with various groups.
<br>
<br>
In high school, I played drums in a few local bands and learned about Afro-Cuban music at Berklee College of Music and the Rivers School Conservatory in Weston, MA.
<br>
<br>
Throughout college I played informally with musicians, improvising in practice rooms. I currently play jazz piano in my apartment in DC and frequently write songs for my fiancé, Jolena. Here are a few selections of my work :
