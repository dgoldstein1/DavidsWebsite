<p>Gone are the days when we have one career for our entire professional life. A fast-paced, connected world needs even more dynamic and cross-discipline work force. Crossing boundaries and disciplines, I put my diversity of skills and assets into all the work I do.</p>

<p>Beyond my work in Computer Science, Arabic, International Relations, or commitment to equal rights and public service, I am a problem solver. I seek to understand how the world works around me and and thrive in an environment where I use this understanding to solve the world&rsquo;s problems with newly energenic and cross-cutting solutions.</p>

<p>Originally from Sharon, Massachusetts, and attened school in Saint Paul, Minnesota, I now live happily with my fianc√© in Washington, D.C., who works at an NGO helping girls in rural Kenya. In my spare time I enjoy hiking in Shenandoah National Park, running around DC, biking along the Potomac, and on rainy days, playing piano by the window or curling up with a good book.</p>

Over the last century, the nature of international conflict has changed drastically, and with it, Humanitarian law and global assistance. More than <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/figures-at-a-glance.html">65 million people are forcibly displaced from their home</a> and the number is growing.
As an advocate for international Human Rights I have made it a priority to assist and amplify the voices of refugees and asylum speakers in the US and abroad.</p>

<p>In the Twin Cities, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to put this mission into action by working with and assisting a diverse set of migrants and refugees. Working for the <a href="http://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/">Advocates for Human Rights</a>, an international NGO based in Minneapolis, and <a href="http://www.karamlaw.com/">Karam Law</a>, a private immigration law firm in Bloomington, MN, I provided French and Arabic translation, assisted in filings to USCIS, helped write briefs and other court filings, and worked with attorneys and immigrants throughout sometimes long and complex legal procedures.</p>

<p>Working at the US State Department in the <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/prm/"> Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration</a> in the Office for the Middle East and Northern Africa, I helped organize vital assistance for refugees in Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Palestine, and Egypt. I also helped lobbying and collaboration efforts with other government entities, such as the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, the White House, and the House and Senate, to affirm the US&rsquo;s commitment to refugees and refugee assistance world-wide.</p>

<p>Since high school, my passion for problem solving, drive to look at problems in unique ways, and appreciation for symetry and harmony in solutions has pushed me towards computer science. Programming lies at the intersection of my personal and academic interests as a tool to draw relationships in data, process and organize large amounts of information beyond the capaibilites of the human mind, and generate new understandings of the world around us.</p>

<p>I am constantly working on new coding projects both inside and outside the office to keep up my coding skills and explore relationships in data in new and interesting ways. Here are a few I&rsquo;ve been working on recently:</p>

<ul>
<li><a style={{text-decoration : "underline"}} href="https://github.com/dgoldstein1/Synonym_Analyzer"> Analyzing synonyms in English using multi-threaded requests and <a href="https://graph-tool.skewed.de/"> Graph Tools</a></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dgoldstein1/ReactTestingTutorial"> A tutorial on testing components in React </a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dgoldstein1/projectEuler"> Solving the Project Euler problem set in C</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dgoldstein1/Directory_Encryptor"> A tool to encrypt filesystems </a></li>
</ul>
